# Scrapping-Yellowpage.
This script would scrape information from yellowpages.
The whole idea is to make it easy to get information from Yellowpages and I would assume for good use.

All you would have to do is supply the url in the body of the get_data_from_url method.

when calling the myscrapper method, you will supply the desired page number as the single arguement.

That will get you the following:
1. Name
2. Street
3. City
4. State
5. Zip
6. Number
